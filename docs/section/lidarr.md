# LIDARR

[Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio/) is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple
RSS feeds for new albums from your favorite artists and will interface with clients and indexers
to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality
of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.
