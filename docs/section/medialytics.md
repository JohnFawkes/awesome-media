Plex itself, as well as other tools, generate statistics regarding your server activity (most watched, most active, etc.) but they don't report much on the nature of your media content itself. Medialytics is a small client-side app that runs in the browser and generates statistics specifically about the content of your server, e.g. top production studio across a libary.
