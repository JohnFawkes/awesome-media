# WRAPPERR

[Wrapperr](https://github.com/aunefyren/wrapperr) is a website-based application for pulling Plex user statistics within a set timeframe
(sourced from [Tautulli](tautulli.md)). The statistics are gathered and processed into a statistics summary.
Then the website displays this in a fun, interactive format. Yes, you need Tautulli to have been
running beforehand and currently for this to work. That is where the data is stored, Wrapperr
just processes and displays it.
