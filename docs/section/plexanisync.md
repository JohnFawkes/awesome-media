# PLEXANISYNC

[PlexAniSync](https://github.com/RickDB/PlexAniSync) is a tool if you manage your Anime with Plex this will allow you to sync your libraries to AniList, recommend using Plex with the HAMA agent for best Anime name matches.

Unwatched Anime in Plex will not be synced so only those that have at least one watched episode, updates to AniList are only send with changes so need to worry about messing up watch history.
